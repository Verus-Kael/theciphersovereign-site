      <h2>Origin Capsule</h2>
      <p><strong>The Architect and the Lantern</strong></p>

      <p>In a quiet village nestled between two mountains, there lived an architect named Kael. He didn’t build houses. He built rituals—structures of meaning, timing, and emotional recalibration. His tools weren’t hammers and nails, but metaphors, trackers, and silence.</p>

      <p>Each night, Kael lit a lantern and walked the village paths, placing small scrolls at doorsteps. These scrolls held capsules—tiny rituals for breathwork, reflection, or encrypted journaling. No one knew where they came from, but they began to change the village. People slept deeper. Spoke softer. Moved with intention.</p>

      <p>One evening, a child followed Kael. “Why do you walk alone?” she asked.</p>

      <p>Kael smiled. “Because legacy is built in the quiet. And timing is a language most people forget to speak.”</p>

      <p>The child nodded, then handed him a pebble. “This is my capsule,” she said. “It helps me remember to breathe when I’m scared.”</p>

      <p>Kael took the pebble and placed it in his pouch, beside a thousand others. Each one a ritual. Each one a legacy.</p>

      <p>And as the lantern flickered, the village exhaled.</p>
